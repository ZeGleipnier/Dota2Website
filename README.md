# Dota2Website
A website that tells the user exactly when the last Dota2 update was. Optimally includes an active ticker from last Update.
Going to attempt to create a couple of fields that reference dates.

>When did Dota 2 last update?<
        <Timestamp>
>Time since last update<
      <Ticker>
      
Approximate HTML format, center both in column and make responsive
Style in CSS simple black bg w/ white text
JavaScript if need be. I think it'll be fairly static unless responsiveness is done in JS
